# CRUD Application
## Products_Products
This project was created with html css node js, I created this project to learn how to do CRUD operations on a json file as a database, The following represents how the project works

### Adding a Product or Creating a Product
When adding a product you'll click on the add product button on the top right to add a product and a form pops up, which you should populate with the data then save to add the product

### Editing the Product
On the products when you click edit, this edits the product and on clicking save this saves the product and saves it to the database,

### Deleting a Product
On the products page, when you click delete, you get a confirmation that asks you if you really want to delete a product. If you confirm this the product is deleted and the page is immediately reloaded,

# Backend
I created a nodejs server in the server.js and the script.js script handles the clientside functionality, which deals with ensuring user interactivity.
